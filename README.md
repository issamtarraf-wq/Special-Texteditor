A simple text editor written in JavaFX to enhance programmer efficiency. What makes this editor unique is that it uses custom two-key sequences instead of traditional modifier keys like Ctrl or Alt. This allows fingers to remain on the home row, which increases both typing speed and comfort.

Features

    Efficiency-Focused: The editor is specifically designed for touch typing to minimize unnecessary hand movements.

    Custom Commands: Text navigation and editing are handled by a special logic that recognizes two consecutive key presses.

    Basic Text Editing: Includes functions for cursor movement, word and line navigation, text selection, and copying, cutting, and pasting.

    Input Control: A MyTextFormatter manages what changes can be made to the text.
